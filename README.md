# Why smiley was abandoned
There were several reasons for this.
- Insufficient knowledge of JavaScript and NodeJS
- Lack of time to maintain the bot
- Blocking of my main Discord account where I owned smiley

1. Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/Tegnio/smiley.git`
2. Navigate to the folder where you've cloned the repository (via terminal)
3. Fill in the `config.json` file.
4. Run `npm i` in your terminal to install all dependencies.
5. Run `node .` to launch the bot.
